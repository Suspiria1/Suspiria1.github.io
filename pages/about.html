                Hey, my name is Jason and I am currently a student learning about programming and web development. I like to
                travel to different places as they have so much to offer.
                I wish to pursue a career in web development, game development, and animation. I like playing games
                but it would be more immersive by being the one who creates them. I currently have some experience in:
                HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, and Python.
            </p>

                <i class='bx bxl-css3'></i>
                <i class='bx bxl-javascript'></i>
                <i class='bx bxl-python'></i>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>
                I became interested in this area from enjoying working with laptops and computers and wanted to create
                programs and applications on them. I find technology interesting and how the future could depend on it.
                Technology is something that will be mostly applied to the definite future as a huge asset. Being involved
                in this field is something I want to take part in.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I want to be able to use my knowledge to innovate products that I like and helps others.
