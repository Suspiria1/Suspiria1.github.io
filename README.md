Welcome to my portfolio website!

My website showcases a bit of information about me, what I have created and also a page to contact me.

Technologies used:
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - Github

The website is responsive as in adjusting based on screen resolution.
The website also is set to light or dark mode based on the system's theme.

Navigation is really easy.
Click through the page links in the navigation bar to switch to different pages.
The name also serves as a link to the home page.
